# serve.py serve an html file generated by backtester.py on localhost:5000

# backtester.py contains an strategy that simulate buys/sells
# from actions from google (GOOG)
# GOOG contains the google prices data, but that data is not updated

# could be cool if we scrap new data from yahoo finance or any other website
# to use it instead

# and if we have time after that, we could storage that new data to the
# mysql container and clean this mess, because we both agree that
# this code is ugly!

# remember the wisdom from uncle Bob:
''' A comment is a failure to express yourself in code.
   If you fail , then write a comment; but try not to fail. '''
